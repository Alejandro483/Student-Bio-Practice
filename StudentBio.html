    Hi, my name is Alejandro. 
</P>
<p>I am a student at University of Wisconsing LaCrosse. I am currently studying a coding boot camp program. Coding caught my attention when I was working as a teacher in St Louis MO. I started a 3D printing class workshop, and some of the 3D projects needed a little bit of coding.
I'm hoping that after finishing this boot camp, I am able to start my own web development company.
